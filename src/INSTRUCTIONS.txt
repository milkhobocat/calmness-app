//this is a guide for when you come across any errors
//you dont have to followw this if you have a better way of doing it :)

-MAKE SURE YOU cd calmness-app EVERY TIME YOU START A NEW TERMINAL :)

///--------FIREBASE SETUP-------------
-ctrl + c to cancel anything

- If you encounter any issues in your terminal saying anything like SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException....etc, type into terminal:
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

-Type this as soon as you as you do the previous line:
>firebase login
>firebase init 
{
    //commands will pop up just follow all these,
    >Y
    // press space to choose and enter
    >( ) Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys
    >build
    //single page question:
    >Y
    //automatic builds question:
    >N
    //overwrite question:
    >Y
    //then rewrite the build
    >npm run build

}

>firebase deploy

-after running all of the above steps, there should be a url link of our hosting site which should be:
Hosting URL: https://calmness-app-fa25b.web.app

^^^if that doesnt show up, i guess you can repeat the above steps again.
feel free to add to this text file if you find anything useful! :)
